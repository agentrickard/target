Target
=====

Allow admins to create block visibility conditions that combine multiple sub-conditions in AND/OR combinations.

That lets us setup target audiences that can easily be applied to multiple blocks, since we only have to set one condition instead of 3 or more on each block.

For instance, using [Condition Pack](https://drupal.org/project/condition_pack), we can create a Nite Out target:

* If today == Friday
* If time > 20:00 hours
* etc.

Then we can define multiple Target personae and track their performance.
